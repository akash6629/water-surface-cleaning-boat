# REMOTE CONTROLLED WATER SURFACE CLEANING BOAT
                              INTRODUCTION

We know that many industries are getting established whose wastes are disposed into water sources which lead to water pollution. Many steps have been taken to reduce emission of toxics present in disposed waste.

To control water pollution . We feel uncomfortable  when we see the water source getting accumulated with solid substance which blocks the flow of water which further arises the problem of water scarcity. Increasing water pollution is a dangerous sign to all organisms living in water(aquatic life)

The solids substance such as plastics, thermocol and other harmful substances which contains harmful toxics like polyvinyl chloride which in commonly known as PVC, most toxic plastic for health and environment. Moreover untreated waste in rivers, seas and lakes result in the accumulation of toxic substances in food chain through the various organisms that feed on it which in return and consumed by humans.

This project is an attempt to solve the problem in food chain through the various organisms that feed on it which in return are consumed by humans.
